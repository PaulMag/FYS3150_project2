*** Choosing the smaller of the roots ***
Can see that by choosing t to be the smaller of the roots, we ensure that the
difference between the matrices A and B is the smallest possible. Then c gets
larger, and c^2 in the denominator in the sum gets small, resulting in a smaller
sum. 

Why this means that the theta <= abs(pi/4) I do not know.

*** n_step and dependency on the choice of rho_max ***
