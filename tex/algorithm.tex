Our interest is to find the solution of the radial part of the
Schrödinger equation, as seen in equation \ref{eq:schrod}.  This
can be done first for one electron and then extended to describe
two electrons including their Coulomb interaction.

\begin{equation}
    -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\left(
    \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{d}{dr}r^2\frac{d}{dr} -
    \frac{l(l+1)}{r^2} \right)R(r) + V(r)R(r) = ER(r)
    \label{eq:schrod}
\end{equation}

Via introducing dimensionless variables for the radius $\rho$ this
equation can be rewritten into equation
\ref{eq:dimensionless_schrod}. Which in turn converts the problem
of solving the radial Schrödinger equation into an eigenvalue
problem where $\lambda$ are the eigenvalues we are interested in.

\begin{equation}
    -\frac{d^2}{d\rho^2}u(\rho) + \rho^2u(\rho) = \lambda
    u(\rho)
    \label{eq:dimensionless_schrod}
\end{equation}
