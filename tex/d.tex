% Task d: Plot the wave function for two electrons as functions of the relative
% coordinate r.

I want to plot the wave functions, or more specifically, the probability
functions for two electrons inside the harmonic oscillator.
To do this I need to find the eigenvectors that correspond to each eigenvalue
of the system. I will only find the wave functions for the ground state and the two lowest
excited states: $\lambda_0$, $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$

The Jacobi Algorithm we used correspond to doing
$$
\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{S}^T_N \cdots \mathbf{S}^T_2 \mathbf{S}^T_1 \mathbf{S}^T_0
             \mathbf{A}
             \mathbf{S}_0 \mathbf{S}_1 \mathbf{S}_2 \cdots \mathbf{S}_N
           = \mathbf{S}^T A \mathbf{S}
$$
where $N$ is the number of iterations that was required to make all the
non-diagonal elements of $\mathbf{B}$ be $\approx 0$ and $\mathbf{S}$ is the
eigenvectors, or eigenfunctions, that correspond to the eigenvectors in
$\mathbf{B}$.
