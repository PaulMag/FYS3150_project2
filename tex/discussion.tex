Implementing the Jacobi rotation algorithm have given us great insight in how some
eigenvalue solvers work. The Jacobi method is easy to implement and understand. The
drawback is that it repeatedly needs to transform elements that were previously set to
zero. Therefore it grows slow for large matrices. For future projects, built-in functions
such as Armadillo's $\verb|eig_sym()|$ are much easier and faster to use, at no expense of
the precision.
