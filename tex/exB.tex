Now that our eigenvalue solver is implemented and working, we can look at how
the results vary for the different parameters $n_{step}$ and  $\rho_{max}$.

First, we decide on a fixed value for $n_{step}$, say $ n_{step} = 100$. By
running the algorithm for various $\rho_{max}$, we can find out approximately
for what $\rho_{max}$ we get the best results.
