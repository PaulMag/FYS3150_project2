Schrödinger's equation is used to describe the nature of particles
on the quantum scale. In this project we will look at Schrödinger's
equation for both one and two electrons in a three-dimensional
harmonic oscillator potential with and without the coulomb
interaction.

We will rewrite Schrödinger's equation in terms of dimensionless
variables and rearrange it into an eigenvalue problem. The
eigenvalues of a real symmetric matrix can be found by reducing the
non-diagonal matrix elements via continuously applying
similarity-transformation until they are all below a certain
predetermined tolerance $\epsilon$.

Furthermore, we will perform an analysis on the exactness of this
method with respect to computational cost.
